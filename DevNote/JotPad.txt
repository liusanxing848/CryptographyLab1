How to from the py version
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker

if run docker-compose encounter:[28324] Error loading Python lib '/tmp/_MEIOyqKiO/libpython3.7m.so.1.0': dlopen: libcrypt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
then run:  sudo yum install libxcrypt-compat
after install, then try run docker-compose

pip3 freeze    (to see which flask version going to be used, in this case, we are using 3.0.0)

Docker file config documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-container-image.html

clone the repo from github to the EC2 machine

sudo docker images
error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
[sudo systemctl start docker] <=use this to fix the error above

if no images running, then run:
	sudo docker-compose build.  (fix error as needed)
then run: 
	sudo docker images   (will see the images is up)

then run:
	sodu docker-compose up

triage issue:
public ip can not be accessed.  => check EC2 security group see the port been opened.

How to launch the instance:
find the instance
Instance action: start the instance 
Wait for the instance state turns to "ready"
Connect to the EC2 (command line)
command: pwd    for check the path. 
navigate to /home/ec2-user/teamA/Lab1
Command:   sudo docker-compose up
Now should be running :)
use the public ip and explore!
